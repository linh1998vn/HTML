  <p>Although the name 'Kapuziner' was used in Vienna, the actual cappuccino was invented in Italy, and the name was
    adapted to become 'Cappuccino. ' It was first made in the early 1900a, shortly after the popularization of the
    espresso machine in 1901. The first record of the cappuccino we have found was in the 1930s</p>
